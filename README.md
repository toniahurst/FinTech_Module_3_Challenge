# FinTech_Module_3_Challenge

This project evaluates arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency markets by comparing bitstamp and coinbase. Using analysis, visualizations, and drawing conclusions, relevant dates are explored to determine if arbitrage is worthwhile on three separate dates.

The three dates initially suggested some promising arbitrage opportunities and probably served to entice some investors.
But, as our analysis revealed, once you take into account the true costs, this was a limited opportunity. Had the investor 
only considered the arbitrage spread and not engaged in a deeper analysis, they would have lost money, especially for 
the final date chosen (March 26th). This is illustrated by the profit_sums for each date which have taken into account the full 
costs of the arbitrage opportunity. 

On Jan. 16th, the first date selected, profit_sum_early = $14,147. 
For the middle date, Feb. 24th, profit_sum_middle = $330.07. 
On the final date, March 26th, profit_sum_late = $0.00.

The best opportunity here was the early opportunity. Even by Feb. 24th, profits were probably not worth the effort to most people, 
and by the late date, there was no profit to be made through arbitrage.
